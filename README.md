# metabarcoding
Includes a p6-loop primer tag set and the sequences for six synthetic standards

The p6-loop is the short locus in the chloroplast genome of plants, and, for vascular plants, is amplified by the trnL gh primers (Taberlet et al. 2007: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl938)

**Tromsø_p6-loop_primer_tags.txt**:
A list of 384 eight or nine base pair tags suitable for p6-loop metabarcoding. The same tag is added to the 5' end of the forward and reverse primers to allow for unique dual tagging of amplicons.

**Tromsø_p6-loop_synthetic_standards.fasta**:
Six synthetic standards for use as positive controls during p6-loop amplification. These sequences are entirely artificial.
**WARNING**: for sensitive environmental or ancient DNA analyses, these pose the same contamination potential as PCR products. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken during their manufacture.
